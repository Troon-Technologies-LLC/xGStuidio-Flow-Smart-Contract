## Instructions for creating Collection, Depositing NFT, Transfereing NFTs between Users

A common order of creating NFT would be
 - Create Admin Account with `transaction/setupAdminAccount`.
 - Owner then make this account Admin, and gives that account ability to create own Brand, Schema and Template with `transactions/addAdminAccount` 
 - Create new Brand with `transactions/createBrand` using Admin Account.
 - Create new Schema with `transactions/createSchema` using Admin Account.
 - Create new Template with `transactions/createTemplate` using Admin Account.
 - Remove the Template with `transactions/removeTemplate` using Admin Account.
 - Create NFT Receiver with `transaction/setupAccount` .
 - Create Mint of Templates and transfer to Address(having Setup Account enabled) with `transaction/mintNFT`
You can also see the scripts in `transactions/scripts` to see how information
can be read from the NFTContract. 

### NFTContract Events

 - Contract Initialized ->
`pub event ContractInitialized()` 
This event is emitted when the `NFTContract` will be initialized.

- Event for Withdraw NFT ->
`pub event Withdraw(id: UInt64, from: Address?)`
This event is emitted when NFT will be withdrawn.

- Event for Deposit NFT ->
`pub event Deposit(id: UInt64, to: Address?)`
This event is emitted when NFT will be deposited.

- Event for Brand ->
`pub event BrandCreated(brandId: UInt64, brandName: String, author: Address, data: {String:String})`
Emitted when a new Brand will be created and added to the smart Contract.

- Event for Brand Update ->
`pub event BrandUpdated(brandId: UInt64, brandName: String, author: Address, data: {String:String})` 
Emitted when a Brand will be update

- Event for Schema ->
`pub event SchemaCreated(schemaId: UInt64, schemaName: String, author: Address)`
Emitted when a new Schema will be created

- Event for Template ->
`pub event TemplateCreated(templateId: UInt64, brandId: UInt64, schemaId: UInt64, maxSupply: UInt64)`
Emitted when a new Template will be created

-  Event for Template Mint ->
`pub event NFTMinted(nftId: UInt64, templateId: UInt64, mintNumber: UInt64)`
Emitted when a Template will be Minted and save as NFT

-  Event for Template removed ->
`pub event TemplateRemoved(templateId: UInt64)`
Emitted when a Template will be removed


## NFTContract Addresses

`NFTContract.cdc`: This is the main NFTContract smart contract that defines
the core functionality of the NFT.

## NFTContract Overview Technical

Each NFTContract represent a standard to create an NFT. We inherited NonFungibleToken to conform our standard with the existent NFT standard.
To Create an NFT, you first have to create a Brand structure which contains following fields:
- brandId: UInt64 (Id of Brand)
- brandName: String (Name of Brand)
- data: {String: String} (Metadata of Brand)
The transaction will create the brand taking input above mentioned fields. We can update metadata later using Update function(only owner can perform this action).

We also have to Create Schema Structure before creating a template using the following fields:
- schameName: String (Name of Schema)
- format: {String: SchemaType} 
The transaction will create the schema taking input above mentioned fields. This schema is like a database structure which is already given and if you want to create a template using that schema. You have to follow schema Structure.

We will then create Template using brandId and schemaId that we created before. Without brandId and schemaId we can't create template. We can create Template using following fields:
- brandId: UInt64 (Foreign Id of Brand)
- schemaId: UInt64 (Foreign Id of Schema)
- maxSupply: UInt64 (maximum NFTs that could be created using that template)
- immutableData: {String: AnyStruct} (Immutable metadata of template)

We then have our Resource type NFT(actual asset) that represents a template owns by a user. It stores its unique Id and NFTData structure contains TemplateId and mintNumber of Template. 

The above transaction can only be performed by an Admin having an Admin resource that will give special capability to any user to create Brands, Schema and Template.

## Instructions for Creating a Collection 

Collections can be created on any account 


## Instructions to Deposit NFTs

NFTs can be only minted by Admin which is Contract Account for now
To Deposit NFTs to accounts having collections, we have to give the following fields:

- recipient: Address

Signer would be Contract Account for now


## Instructions to Transfer NFTs

To Transfer NFTs within the accounts having Collection, we have to give the following fields:

- recipient: Address
- id: UInt64


### Deployment Contract on Emulator

-  Run `flow project deploy --network emulator`
    - All contracts are deployed to the emulator.

After the contracts have been deployed, you can run the sample transactions
to interact with the contracts. The sample transactions are meant to be used
in an automated context, so they use transaction arguments and string template
fields. These make it easier for a program to use and interact with them.
